  "description": "It takes a very hardened sort of individual not to feel and empathise with the pain of new parents sitting outside the Intensive Care Unit where their little one is struggling to live. She's only four days old, her father, George Ajoury, told us.I was breastfeeding her, Nelly Ajoury, her mother explained. \"I tried my best to protect her but I just couldn't.\" Mrs Ajoury has a broken nose and stitches in her arms, legs, thighs and forehead from the shards of glass which have pierced her skin multiple times. Her little newborn daughter Sophie looks like a bundle of vulnerability. She has a large bandage wrapped round her head and is being monitored in an incubator whilst doctors decide what the best course of treatment for her is. They fear she'll need surgery to relieve the pressure on her brain caused by swelling and bleeding. \"We just hope she's okay,\" says her tearful mother. \"We just want her to be okay. We're not leaving without her.\"",
