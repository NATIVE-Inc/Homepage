# Playground

This is @realJema *playground* with react to learn how it works and t work on some interesting projects. 


### Learning React 
#### Book: Pro React 
> *Build Complex front-end Applications in a composable way with React*

React is an engine for building composable user interfaces using JavaScript and (optionally) XML.


##### package.json
A **package.json** file. The package.json is a standard npm manifest file
that holds various information about the project, such a name, description,
information about the author, etc. It lets the developer specify dependencies
(that can get automatically downloaded and installed) and define script tasks

##### Props
A key factor to make components reusable and composable is the ability to configure them, Props are the mechanism used in React for passing data from parent to child components.
syntax: 
    this.props.<name>

they can't be changed by the child, they are owned by the parent.
